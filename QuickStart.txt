One-Command Deployment
Hexo provides a fast and easy deployment strategy. You only need one single command to deploy your site to your server.

$ hexo deploy
Install the necessary plugin(s) that is compatible with the deployment method provided by your server/repository.

Deployment is usually configured through _config.yml. A valid configuration must have the type field. For example:

deploy:
  type: git
You can use multiple deployers. Hexo will execute each deployer in order.

deploy:
- type: git
  repo:
- type: heroku
  repo:
Refer to the Plugins list for more deployment plugins.

Git
Install hexo-deployer-git.
$ npm install hexo-deployer-git --save
Edit _config.yml (with example values shown below as comments):
deploy:
  type: git
  repo: <repository url> # https://bitbucket.org/JohnSmith/johnsmith.bitbucket.io

token	Optional token value to authenticate with the repo. Prefix with $ to read token from environment variable
Deploy your site hexo clean && hexo deploy.
You will be prompted with username and password of the target repository, unless you authenticate with a token or ssh key.
hexo-deployer-git does not store your username and password. Use git-credential-cache to store them temporarily.

Netlify
Netlify provides continuous deployment (Git-triggered builds), an intelligent global CDN, full DNS (including custom domains), automated HTTPS, asset acceleration, and a lot more. It is a unified platform that automates your code to create high-performance, easily maintainable sites and web apps.

There are two different ways to deploy your sites on Netlify. The most common way is to use the web UI. Go to the create a new site page, select your project repo from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and follow the prompts.

Alternatively, you can use Netlify’s Node based CLI tool to manage and deploy sites on Netlify without leaving your terminal.

You can also add a Deploy to Netlify Button in your README.file to allow others to create a copy of your repository and be deployed to Netlify via one click.
